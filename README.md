# A Hundred Dogs
Source Code For A Game I Created In 48 Hours For Ludum Dare 42.

This game procedurally generates rooms and spawns 100 dogs in which the player has to take care of them all. While the code is a bit sloppy, this is because the game was created from start to finish within ~72 hours. I will be making updates as time progresses in order to optimize the performance and cleanup the code.
